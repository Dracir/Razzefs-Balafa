introHarry : And so, [wizard1] the Wizard, whose name was borrowed from ancient wizard texts, though he bears no resemblance to the original, entered Vancer's castle [company]. [LB][LB] "If I can just get there in time, I may be one of the first people to witness the Ancient One!" [wizard1], a long-time scholar of the Ancient One and his bizarre effects on the world, desires nothing more than to be present at its summoning. He is fully aware it may leave him a mindless heap, a writhing maniac, or even to serve as a cosmic butler for all of eternity. No price is too great for this opportunity.

Help [wizard1] make it to the top of the tower first, and witness the ceremony!

introRincewind : And so, [wizard2] the Wizard

GANDALF: No.
HARRY: I could use a snack, actually.

MYSTERIO: It was just a thought....
